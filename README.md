# ZooAnimalManagmentSystem

This project is not completely finished.

It was aimed to have all the necesary features, like transfering inputs from Json and based on the requirements saving data to database and aplying each animal an enclosure. And also all the CRUD operations.

I had some issues while testing with the api/animals/transfer POST request and couldn't fix it.
